# Flexible Staking

Flexible Staking refers to a type of staking system in which users can choose to stake their tokens for a specific amount of time, and can also choose to unstake their tokens before the end of the staking period. This allows users to have more control and flexibility over their staked tokens, and can be a useful feature for those who may need to access their tokens for various reasons before the end of the staking period.
