# Token Swaps

**Swap Tokens** is a simple way to exchange one token for another via an automated liquidity pool. For example, if you only have USDT Tokens, and you want to own LDX Tokens as the LDX Token is very useful. You have to exchange the tokens from USDT to LDX in the Swap feature. And that applies to other Tokens/Coins. And if you don't find a Token that can be exchanged, for example USDT Token wants to be exchanged for ETH, but is not available in the Swap feature. That means the USDT/ETH Liquidity Pool is yet for avail.

When you do a token exchange \(trade\) on an exchange, you will pay a fairly low fee of 0.30%.
