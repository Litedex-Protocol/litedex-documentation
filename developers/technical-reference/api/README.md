This section explains the Litedex Subgraph and how to interact with it. The Litedex subgraph indexes data from the Litedex contracts over time. It organizes data about pairs, tokens, Litedex as a whole, and more. The subgraph updates any time a transaction is made on Litedex. The subgraph runs on [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) protocol's hosted service and can be openly queried.
