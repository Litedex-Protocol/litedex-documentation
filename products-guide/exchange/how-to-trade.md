LITEDEX puts a lot of effort into making trading easy for both novice and experienced users. LITEDEX Team had created an easy to understand interface and teaching the steps on how to use it through the LITEDEX documentation.

**Trading preparation**

Before you make a trade, you must have a Wallet. If you don't have it, you can learn and make it [here ](../../get-started/how-to-make-a-wallet.md)at the same time. And if you already have a Wallet, make sure you again have Tokens to trade.

**Trade on the LITEDEX exchange**

1. Visit the exchange page [here](https://swap.litedex.io/#/swap)

2. After visiting the Website, you must connect the Wallet to the LITEDEX platform. Click “Connect to a wallet”.

3. Select the Token you want to trade from the drop down menu or the down arrow icon in the “From” section. In this tutorial, BSC Coin default settings. Since we are swapping on the BSC Blockchain, if you are using the ETH Blockchain, the default setting is ETH and it changes depending on Blockchain. Even though it is set by default, you can replace it with any Coin you want, for example We use BNB Coin to exchange to LDX Coin \(Can be replaced with other coins\). Before swapping, make sure your balance is sufficient.
