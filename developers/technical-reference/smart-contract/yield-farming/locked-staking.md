# Locked Staking

Locked staking refers to the process of holding and locking up a cryptocurrency in a specific wallet or smart contract in order to participate in the operation of a blockchain network and earn rewards. The term "locked" refers to the fact that the staked cryptocurrency is not available for use or transfer until the staking period has ended and the lockup period has expired.
